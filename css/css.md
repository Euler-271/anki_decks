Question 5.
What is the purpose of media queries, and how do you use them to create responsive layouts?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
Media queries in CSS are used to apply different styles to a web page based on the characteristics of the device or screen it's viewed on, such as width, height, or orientation.

Question 6.
What are CSS selectors and how do they work?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements. They define the elements to which a set of CSS rules should be applied. Selectors can target elements based on their type, class, ID, attributes, and more.

For example:

Element Selector: Targets specific HTML elements. Example: p { color: blue; }
Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class attribute. Example: .my-class { font-weight: bold; }
ID Selector: Targets a single element with a specific ID attribute. Example: #my-id { text-decoration: underline; }
Attribute Selector: Targets elements based on their attribute values. Example: input[type="text"] { background-color: #f0f0f0; }
Selectors can also be combined to create more specific and targeted styles.

What is the concept of "inheritance" in CSS and how does it affect the cascading nature of styles?

Question 9.
Question: What is the difference between margin and padding in CSS?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
Margin: Margin is the space outside the border of an element. It clears the area between the border and adjacent elements. It does not have a background color, and it's transparent by default. Margin is used for creating space between elements.
Example: margin: 10px;

Padding: Padding is the space between the content of an element and its border. It clears the area between the content and the border. Padding is often used to increase the readability and aesthetics of the content inside an element.
Example: padding: 10px;

In summary, margin is the space outside the border, and padding is the space inside the border around the content.

Question 11.
Question: Describe the CSS "z-index" property and explain its use in stacking elements.
